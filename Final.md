## Overview

*B**e**l**l**a**b**e**a**t*
(<https://bellabeat.com/?)> is a women-centric tech and wellness company
which develops wearables and accompanying products that monitor
biometric and lifestyle data to help women better understand how their
bodies work, and as a result, make healthier lifestyle choices. Together
with the Bellabeat app, users are able to gain insights with health data
related to their activity, sleep, stress, fitness, heart rate,
reproductive health and mindfulness habits. The aim of this project is
to analyze how non-Bellabeat consumers use their smart fitness devices.
With this information, we are to provide high-level recommendations for
how these insights can inform Bellabeatâ€™s marketing strategy.

This analysis consists of 6 phase: \*\*Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze,
Share\*\* and \*\*Act\*\*.
